# Pathfinder
Pathfinder was born out of a desire to do less and achieve more. I kept seing in my software engineering textbook the work computer-aided, computer assisted software engineering tools.
These tools were supposed to help software engineers be more productive by automating some of the tedious tasks involved in software development. However, I'm too lazy to go looking for tools that may, or may not, help me.
The nonlinear fashion of requirements gathering and analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance makes it difficult. Pathfinder is not really defined yet, but the idea is to have a tool that helps me be more productive by automating some of the tedious tasks involved in software development.
For example, it helps me build CPM graphs, and paint a picture of my project schedule. This was inspired by the fact that I was tired of drawing CPM graphs with a mouse, or using a text-based tool. Why should I draw CPM graphs with a mouse, when I can just type in the tasks and their dependencies, and have the tool generate the graph for me?

## Job as the SE
Interviews, short chats, and questionnaires to gather requirements are common techniques, but a questionnaire takes time to prepare, and it's only useful once, and if the questions are well thought out.
Brainstorming in informal settings can yield useful insights, but it's hard to document and analyze the results. Pathfinder aims to streamline this process by providing templates and tools to quickly gather and organize requirements (not there yet).

Pathfinder is a work in progress, and I hope to add more features in the future. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
