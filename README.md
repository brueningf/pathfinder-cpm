# Pathfinder
Pathfinder was born out of a desire to do less and achieve more. I kept seing in my software engineering textbook the work computer-aided, computer assisted software engineering tools. Abstraction of analysis, design, and computer program design into automated tools.
These tools were supposed to help software engineers be more productive by automating some of the tedious tasks involved in software development. However, I'm too lazy to go looking for tools that may, or may not, help me.
The nonlinear fashion of requirements gathering and analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance makes it difficult. Pathfinder is not really defined yet, but the idea is to have a tool that helps me be more productive by automating some of the tedious tasks involved in software development.
For example, it helps me build CPM graphs, and paint a picture of my project schedule. This was inspired by the fact that I was tired of drawing CPM graphs with a mouse, or using a text-based tool. Why should I draw CPM graphs with a mouse, when I can just type in the tasks and their dependencies, and have the tool generate the graph for me?

## Job as the SE
Interviews, short chats, and questionnaires to gather requirements are common techniques, but a questionnaire takes time to prepare, and it's only useful once, and if the questions are well thought out.
Brainstorming in informal settings can yield useful insights, but it's hard to document and analyze the results. Pathfinder aims to streamline this process by providing templates and tools to quickly gather and organize requirements (not there yet).

## Mental model
As a SE, I need a mental model of the project. However, as I gain experience, I realize that my mental model is often incomplete or inaccurate. I can't always keep track of all the moving parts, and I often forget important details.
Actually, I can track at most 3-4 things at a time then it gets complicated. I need a way to free up my heap. Pathfinder hopefully will help me build and maintain a mental model of the project by providing visualizations and summaries of the project's status (not there yet).
I don't wish to get trapped in my thought processes. We need to do the out of the box thinking. Pathfind shoudl be a tool that helps me think outside the box by providing alternative perspectives and insights into the project (not there yet).

## Handling of compromises
If your client/boss/stakeholder hasn't brought up a possible feature in your late stage of engineering, you are probably just starting your engineering career. I can't remember the last time a project went exactly as planned. 
There are always compromises to be made, whether it's due to time constraints, budget limitations, or changing requirements. We need a way to alter our plans and adapt to new circumstances. A change in one part of the project can have a ripple effect on other parts.
I want to focus on building, and not on planning, and re-planning, and rewriting stuff. In that case I could as well apply for a job as an accountant. The idea is to have a tool that helps me manage changes and adapt to new circumstances by providing easy ways to update plans and visualize the impact of changes.
This without much hassle from my side. Estimations shoudl be done automatically, and diagrams, and graphs should be updated automatically.

## Teamwork
Software engineering is often a team effort (if not always), and effective communication and collaboration are essential for success. A collaborative environment is planned, but as I'm a sole developer at the moment this will take some time to implement.
Unless you boost my motivation with some coffee.
This is how i envision teamwork. The team, the session, joint structured process, meeting facilitator, documentation tools, and follow-up mechanisms. Pathfinder should provide tools to facilitate communication and collaboration among team members.
The team is composesd of client representatives, facilitator, system representatives, and support people. Ideally 3-4 people, and definitly less than 10. Interfaces should be simple and intuitive, so that everyone can use them without much training. At the same time specialist tools should be available for advanced users/defined roles.

Facilitator functions include: cheerleader, conflict solution, defusing triggers, keeping the session on track, and ensuring that everyone has a chance to contribute.
Support people: note taking, time keeping, link to external resources, and bridging plan to reality gap. Coordination of very important coffee breaks, and meals. Distribution of messages to and from the team.

## Data analysis
Because data is important, Pathfinder should provide tools to analyze and visualize data related to the project. This includes tools for tracking progress, identifying bottlenecks, and measuring performance.
Collecting metrics, and building statistics of how often, how much, when, for all data and processes involved in the project. This will help make informed decisions and improve the overall quality of the project.


Pathfinder is a work in progress, and I hope to add more features in the future. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.
